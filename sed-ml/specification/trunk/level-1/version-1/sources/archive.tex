\subsection{SED-ML archives}
\label{sec:archive} 
A \concept{SED-ML archive} is a self-contained repository of all the resources necessary to run a simulation and display its output. It may be a convenient alternative if a model  source URI cannot be resolved,  or if an end-user is offline. 

An archive is zipped folder containing one SED-ML file and any number of model files. By convention,
 the name of the archive will be the name of the SED-ML file contained in the archive, with the suffix ``.sedx". Each model file contained in the archive is  referred to  by a relative URI  in the \concept{source} attribute of the SED-ML document's  \hyperref[class:model]{model} element.
 
 For example, the contents of  an archive, when unzipped, may be as follows:
 
 Name of archive: Mysedml.sedx\\
 Contents: 
 \begin{verbatim}
 Mysedml.xml
 model1.xml
 model2.xml
 \end{verbatim}
 Listing \ref{lst:miase} shows how a model would be referenced in the SED-ML file \emph{Mysedml.xml} in the above example.
 
 Future versions of SED-ML may expand the permitted contents of an archive to include experimental data files or other resources.
