\chapter{The COMBINE archive}
\label{app:archive}
A \concept{COMBINE archive} is a single file containing the various documents
(and in the future, references to documents), necessary for the description of
a model and all associated data and procedures. This includes for instance, but
not limited to, simulation experiment descriptions in SED-ML, all models needed
to run the simulations in SBML and their graphical representations in SBGN-ML.
It is a convenient alternative if a model source URI cannot be resolved,  or if
an end-user is offline.

The SED-ML archive described in appendix D of the SED-ML Level $1$ Version $1$
specification formed the basis for the COMBINE archive with contributions from
the SED-ML and COMBINE communities.

The COMBINE archive is described at: \url{http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive}
