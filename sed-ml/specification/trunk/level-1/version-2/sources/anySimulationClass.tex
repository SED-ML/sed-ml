% simulation class
\label{class:anySimulation}
For the time being, SED-ML offers a \concept{general simulation class} called \code{AnySimulation} which can be used for all different kinds of simulation experiments not yet defined. Using the general \code{propertyName} and \code{propertyValue} allows working groups to define their own specifications for simulation classes.

%One example for such user defined simulation type could be the simulation of a synapse in neuro science.
