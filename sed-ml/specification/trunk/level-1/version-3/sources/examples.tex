\chapter{Examples}

This appendix present a few examples SED-ML uses. These examples are only illustrative and do not intend to demonstrate the full capabilities of SED-ML. Please read the specification for  a for a more comprehensive view (Chapter~\ref{chp:specification}). 

The current examples make use of models encoded in SBML and CellML. It is important to remember that SED-ML is not restricted to those formats, but can be used with models encoded in many formats, so long as they are serialized in XML. A list of formats known to have been used, at least tentatively, with SED-ML is available on \url{http://sed-ml.org/}.
