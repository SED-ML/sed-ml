The \hyperref[class:repeatedTask]{repeatedTask} introduced in \LoneVtwo makes it possible to encode a large number of different simulation experiments. In this section several simulation experiment are presented that use the repeated tasks construct. 

\subsection{One dimensional steady state parameter scan}
Here the repeated task calls out to a \hyperref[class:oneStep]{oneStep} task (performing a steady state computation). Each time a parameter is carried in order to collect different responses. 


In the description below the range to be used in the \hyperref[class:setValue]{setValue} construct use of the \token{range} attribute.
