Some variables used in an experiment are not explicitely defined in the model, but may be implicitely contained in it. 
For example, to plot a variable's behaviour over time, that variable is defined in an SBML model, but time will not explicitely be defined.

To overcome that shortness and allow SED-ML to refer to such variables in a common way, the notion of \emph{implicit variables} is used.
Those variables are called symbols in SED-ML and are defined externally in the \alert{SED-ML namespace}, following the idea of MIRIAM URNs and using the SED-ML URN scheme \element{urn:sedml:symbol:}\emph{implicit variable}.
To refer from a SED-ML file to the definition of \emph{time}, for example, the URN is \element{urn:sedml:symbol:time}.

The list of predefined symbols is available from the SED-ML site on \url{http://biomodels.net/sed-ml}.
From that source, also a mapping of SED-ML symbols on possibly existing concepts in the single languages supported by SED-ML is provided.
