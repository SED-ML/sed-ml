\abstract{
More sophisticated computational simulations are needed to help physicians personalize medicine and help bioengineers design biology. Such simulations will likely require extensive collaboration among modelers, experimentalists, and engineers. The Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) guidelines outline the information needed to share simulation experiments. SED-ML is a computer-readable format for the information outlined by MIASE. The first versions of SED-ML focused on deterministic and stochastic simulations of models described in the CellML and SBML model languages. Importantly, SED-ML is a community project that many investigators and software tools support.

Level~1 Version~4 of SED-ML substantially expands the capabilities of SED-ML to additional types of models, model languages, parameter estimations, simulations and analyses of models, and analyes and visualizations of simulation results. To facilitate consistent practices across the community, Level~1 Version~4 also fills numerous gaps in the specifications of SED-ML with concrete validation rules. Level~1 Version~4 is defined by a detailed specification.

SED-ML is supported by a growing ecosystem of investigators, model languages, and software tools, including eight languages for constraint-based, kinetic, qualitative, rule-based, and spatial models, over 20 simulation tools, visual editors, model repositories, and validators. More information about SED-ML is available at \url{https://sed-ml.org/}.}
