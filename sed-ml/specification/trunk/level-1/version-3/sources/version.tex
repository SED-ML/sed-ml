\subsubsection{\element{version}}
\label{sec:version}
The current SED-ML \concept{version} is ``version \version''. Minor revisions containing corrections and refinements of SED-ML elements, or new constructs which do not affect backwards compatibility, will lead to the definition of forthcoming versions.

The version attribute is \code{required} and its value is a \code{fixed} decimal. For SED-ML \currentLV the value is set to \code{2}, as shown in the example in Listing~\ref{lst:sedmlRoot}.
