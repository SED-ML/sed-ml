      <h2 id="sedmlProposals">Guidelines for feature requests and proposals</h2>
      <p>We would like to encourage you to follow the procedure below for contributing to SED-ML development. </p>
      <h3>Feature requests</h3>
      <p>
        Feature requests are “wishes for support” by (potential)
              SED-ML users. They are submitted and tracked using the
              SourceForge <a
          href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=293618&amp;atid=1240598">feature request tracker</a>. The editors will revise these
              wishes at their regular meetings and start discussion on
              them on sed-ml-discuss if necessary. Solutions to feature
              requests can be provided (independently of a feature
              request) by starting a new proposal item on SF.
             
      </p>
      <h3>Proposals</h3>
      <p>
        Proposals are welcome at all times via the sourceforge <a
          href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=2532228&amp;group_id=293618">proposals
                tracker</a>. Proposals could be derived from a
              sed-ml-discuss discussion field (for example, in response
              to a feature request), or created de novo.
             
        <ul>
          <li>Together with your proposal you must provide a
                  sufficiently detailed description of your desired
                  feature, including XML examples, i.e. SED-ML files,
                  containing the proposed new elements in Annotation
                  elements. Final element and attribute names may be
                  decided on later (maybe even hierarchy).</li>
          <li>The editors then collect vote on whether the
                  outlined proposal goes in to the right direction and
                  should become part of SED-ML.
                 
            <ul>
              <li>The proposal will be voted on by sedml-discuss
                      members, </li>
              <li>requiring a majority in favour to be accepted.
                      The vote includes yes-no-revise options.</li>
              <li>There will be no minimum requirement for the
                      the number of votes needed. </li>
              <li>The voting process will take place over a 3
                      week period. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Proposals that are rejected will not be rejected
                  for all time, but would need to address the reasons
                  for their rejection before resubmission. Resubmission
                  therefore requires revision of the proposal.</li>
          <li>Accepted proposals will be integrated with the
                  specification document by the SED-ML editors with the next release.
                  Prerequisites are:
                 
            <ul>
              <li>at least two implementations in applications (
                      to demonstrate interoperability) </li>
              <li>updated examples </li>
              <li>a written description of the proposal </li>
            </ul>
            and ideally would include:
                 
            <ul>
              <li>an XML schema for the proposed extension </li>
              <li>UML diagrams illustrating any new class </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
