\subsection{SED-ML resources}
% further resources
%Further information on SED-ML as well as an extensive example for a SED-ML file can be be found in ``SED-ML -- An XML Format for the Implementation of the MIASE Guidelines'' \citep{KL08a}.
% -> I removed the reference to the CMSB paper, as the UML is slightly different to the one presented there. To avoid confusion.

SED-ML is part of the biomodels.net initiative \url{http://www.biomodels.net}. Information on SED-ML can be found on \url{http://www.biomodels.net/sed-ml}.

The SED-ML XML Schema, the UML schema and related implementations, libraries, validators and so on can be found on the SED-ML sourceforge project page \url{http://sed-ml.svn.sourceforge.net/}.
