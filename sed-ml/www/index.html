        <h2>What is SED-ML?</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the home page of the <b>Simulation Experiment
            Description Markup Language</b> (SED-ML). SED-ML is an XML-based format
            for encoding simulation setups, to ensure exchangeability and
            reproducibility of simulation experiments. It follows the
            requirements defined in the <a href="http://biomodels.net/miase">MIASE
            guidelines</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current version is <b>SED-ML Level 1 Version 2</b> and covers
            the description of time course simulation experiments as well as
            repeated tasks and steady state experiments.
        </p>

            SED-ML is a <b>community project</b> that is under continuous

            comprises simulation software developers and modelers from the
            different communities applying computational methods on biology,
