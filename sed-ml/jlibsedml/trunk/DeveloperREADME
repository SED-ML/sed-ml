This is a preliminary implementation of a Sed-ML validating parser. This has been developed in Eclipse. If you use Eclipse as your Java IDE,
this project should import as a java project with its classpath set properly (subject to library requirements below).

Library requirements
---------------------

JaxB is needed to generate classes from the schema. In this project we are using JaxB2.1.9,
however in combination with JDk6 this can cause problems as this JDK comes bundled with an earlier version
of JaxB. To overcome this you need to add the following system property, for the tests to run.

-Djava.endorsed.dirs="lib/jaxb-2.1.9"

For JDK5, this problem does not exist, as it does not contain JAxb, in this case you may need to add more jaxb jars to the classpath.



Ant build file
--------------
Running the 'main' task regenerates classes, compiles java source and generates a jar file of the library in the top level of the project

Unit tests
----------

JUnit tests run using JUnit4, which needs to be added to the classpath to execute them.
