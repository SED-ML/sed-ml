\subsubsection{\element{level}}
\label{sec:level}

The current SED-ML \concept{level} is ``level \level''. Major revisions containing substantial changes will lead to the definition of forthcoming levels.

The level attribute is \code{required} and its value is a \code{fixed} decimal. For SED-ML \LoneVtwo the value is set to \code{1}, as shown in the example in Listing~\ref{lst:sedmlRoot}.
