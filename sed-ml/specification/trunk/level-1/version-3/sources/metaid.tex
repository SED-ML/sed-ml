\subsubsection{\element{metaid}}
\label{sec:metaID}
The main purpose of the \element{metaid} attribute is to attach semantic annotations in form of the \hyperref[class:annotation]{Annotation} class to SED-ML elements.  The type of \code{metaid} is XML ID and as such the \code{metaid} attribute is globally unique throughout the whole SED-ML document. 

An example showing how to link a semantic annotation to a SED-ML object via the \element{metaid} is given in the \hyperref[class:annotation]{Annotation} class description.
