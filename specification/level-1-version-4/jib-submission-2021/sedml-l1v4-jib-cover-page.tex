\abstract{
The increasing use of computational simulation experiments to inform modern biological research creates new challenges to annotate, archive, share and reproduce such experiments. The Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes a minimal set of information that should be provided to allow the reproduction of simulation experiments among users and software tools.

SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally provides an XML schema.

SED-ML Level~1 Version~4 covers the description of time course and steady state simulations, parameter estimation experiments, and introduces a generic construct to allow new experiments to be described without the need to update this core specification.  For all descriptions, SED-ML provides a way to define the data, models, modifications, simulations, analyses, and results of each experiment it describes.  These descriptions are independent of the underlying model implementation.  SED-ML is a software-independent format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it is not specific to particular simulation tools.  Additional materials and resources are available from the SED-ML project website at \url{http://sed-ml.org/}.}
