  <p style="font-size:14px">
    This work is related to Combined Heat and Power generation. There is a very small risk that something goes wrong. If the temperature gets too high in the data center (which they thing is very unlikely), they will need to power off machines and storage. 
    This will affect access to all services hosted at the EBI, including sed-ml.org.

      <h2>What is SED-ML?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the home page of the <b>Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language</b> (SED-ML). 
        SED-ML is an XML-based format for encoding simulation setups, to ensure exchangeability and reproducibility of simulation experiments. It follows the requirements defined in the <a
          href="http://biomodels.net/miase">MIASE guidelines</a>.
        <!--          SED-ML allows the definition of the model(s) to be used, the          experimental task(s) to be run, and the result(s) to be           produced. SED-ML currently only covers some of the           
requirements for MIASE compliant simulation descriptions. On           the other hand, the formalisation of SED-ML forces the           information to be more precise than the bare MIASE  requirements. -->
      </p>
      <p>The current version is <b>SED-ML Level 1 Version 1</b> and covers the description of time course simulation experiments.</p>

      <h2>The SED-ML community</h2>
      <p>
        SED-ML is a <b>community project</b> that is under continuous development, currently exploring the extension of SED-ML to cover more simulation experiment types. <br/>
The SED-ML community comprises simulation software developers and modelers from the different communities applying computational methods on biology, medicine, neuroscience etc. Several instruments guarantee the open discussion of the SED-ML language development:<br />
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>sed-ml-discuss</dt>
        <dd>The official mailing list for the SED-ML project is sed-ml-discuss. The mailing list is free for everyone to join. It is the place where all issues regarding the SED-ML language are being discussed. Announcements of SED-ML related events and support issues are posted on SED-ML disucss. Requests for new SED-ML features should be made through the mailing list also. Another important function of the mailing list is the voting for SED-ML editors, as well as for SED-ML proposals. Subscription to the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sed-ml-discuss/">mailing list</a> are always welcome.</dd>
        <dt>Sourceforge project site</dt>
        <dd>The SED-ML Sourceforge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sed-ml/">project site</a> hosts all code related to the SED-ML language, including the SED-ML XML Schema, the SED-ML specification document, SED-ML feature requests and proposals for SED-ML extensions.</dd>
        <dt>SED-ML editors</dt>
        <dd>The SED-ML editors are being elected by the members of the sed-ml-discuss mailing list for a period of three years. SED-ML editors are responsible for hosting all material relevant to SED-ML, coordinating the SED-ML development, maintaining the SED-ML sourceforge website and the SED-ML specification document. The list of current and past SED-ML editors is being made available through the SED-ML <a href="about.html">web page.</a></dd>
        <dt>SED-ML meetings</dt>
        <dd>SED-ML is part of the <a href="http://co.mbine.org/">COMBINE</a> effort. The SED-ML community meets twice a year, at the annual COMBINE meeting and at the annual HARMONY meeting.</dd>
