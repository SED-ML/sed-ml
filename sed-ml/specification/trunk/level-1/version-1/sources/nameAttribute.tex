\label{sec:name}
%
Besides an \hyperref[sec:id]{id}, a SED-ML constituent may carry an optional \concept{name} attribute. However, names do not have identifying character and so  severeal SED-ML constituents may carry the same name. The purposes of the \concept{name} attribute is to keep a human-readible name of the constituent, e.\,g. for display to the user. Names are of the data type \code{String} in the XML Schema representation.
