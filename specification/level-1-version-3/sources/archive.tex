\chapter{COMBINE archive}
\label{app:archive}
A \concept{COMBINE archive} \citep{Bergmann2014} is a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. A COMBINE archive file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.

The COMBINE archive is described at \url{http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive} and 
in \citep{Bergmann2014}.

COMBINE archives are the recommended means for distributing simulation experiment descriptions in SED-ML, the respective data and model files, and the simulation results (figures and reports).
