\label{sec:id}
%

Most objects in SED-ML carry the \concept{id} and \hyperref[sec:name]{name} attributes. 
The \concept{id} attribute, if existent for an object, is always required and can be used to identify SED-ML constituents unambiguously.  The {id} attribute can be used to refer to a constituent from other constituents. 
The \code{id} data type is \code{String}. All \code{id}s have a global scope, meaning that throughout a whole SED-ML document, the \code{id} should be unambiguous and as such identifying the constituent it is related to.
An example for a defined \concept{id} is given in listing \ref{lst:id}.
