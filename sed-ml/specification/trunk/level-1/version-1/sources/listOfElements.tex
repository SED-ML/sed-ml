\label{listOfElements}
\concept{listOf*} elements in SED-ML serve as containers  for a collection of objects of the same type. For example, the \concept{listOfModels} contains all \hyperref[class:model]{Model} objects of a SED-ML document. Lists do not carry any further semantics, nor do they add additional attributes to the language. They might, however, be annotated with \hyperref[class:notes]{Notes} and \hyperref[class:annotation]{Annotations} as they are derived from \hyperref[class:sbase]{SBase}.
All \concept{listOf*} elements are optional in a SED-ML document. 

SED-ML uses the following \concept{listOf*} elements:

%%% Local Variables: 
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-master: "../sed-ml-L1V1"
%%% End:
